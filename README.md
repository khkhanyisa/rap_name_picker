# Rap Name Picker

A fun beginner-friendly Python project that generates random rap names based on your mood and personal answers.

## How It Works

The program asks you a few questions based on your vibe (e.g. "chill", "savage", "energetic", or "bored") and combines your answers in creative ways to give you a unique rap name, such as:
- Lil bLaCk pIzZa
- savage ps 2
- DJ Blue Moonwalk
- KA Deroba

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khkhanyisa/rap_name_picker.git
   cd rap_name_picker
3. Run the file using this command:
    ```bash
