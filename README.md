A fun beginner-friendly Python CLI project that generates random rap names based on your mood and personal answers.

## How It Works

The program asks you a few questions based on your vibe (e.g. "chill", "savage", "energetic", or "bored") and combines your answers in creative ways to give you a unique rap name, such as:
- Lil bLaCk pIzZa
- savage ps 2
- DJ Blue Moonwalk
- KA Deroba
